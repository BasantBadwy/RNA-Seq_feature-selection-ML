# RNA-Seq feature_selection and ML

In this repository, we employ a hybrid feature selection approach combined with machine learning to predict melanoma patients' responses to ICB therapy using RNA-Seq data. Our feature selection process includes two filter methods, univariate ROC-AUC and RliefF, along with one wrapper method, SVM-RFE. 
We achieve optimal classification accuracy through ensemble voting among five renowned machine learning classifiers.
